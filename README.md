# Webscreen

A simple screensaver, thinly wrapping [WKWebView][].

Inspired by, but shares no code with, [WebViewScreenSaver][], which uses
WebView which doesn't have the sort of performance WKWebView can offer.

Also my first serious foray into Swift, as well as the consequences that
arise from Swift within ScreenSaverEngine.
